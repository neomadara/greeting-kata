## Requirement 1

Write a method `greet(name)` that interpolates `name` in a simple greeting. For example, when `name` is `"Bob"`, the method should return a string `"Hello, Bob."`.

## Requirement 2

Handle nulls by introducing a stand-in. For example, when `name` is null, then the method should return the string `"Hello, my friend."`

## Requirement 3

Handle shouting. When `name` is all uppercase, then the method should shout back to the user. For example, when `name` is `"JERRY"` then the method should return the string `"HELLO JERRY!"`

## Requirement 4

Handle two names of input. When `name` is an array of two names (or, in languages that support it, varargs or a splat), then both names should be printed. For example, when `name` is `["Jill", "Jane"]`, then the method should return the string `"Hello, Jill and Jane."`

## Requirement 5

Handle an arbitrary number of names as input. When `name` represents more than two names, separate them with commas and close with an Oxford comma and "and". For example, when `name` is `["Amy", "Brian", "Charlotte"]`, then the method should return the string `"Hello, Amy, Brian, and Charlotte."`

## Requirement 6

Allow mixing of normal and shouted names by separating the response into two greetings. For example, when `name` is `["Amy", "BRIAN", "Charlotte"]`, then the method should return the string `"Hello, Amy and Charlotte. AND HELLO BRIAN!"`

## Requirement 7

If any entries in `name` are a string containing a comma, split it as its own input. For example, when `name` is `["Bob", "Charlie, Dianne"]`, then the method should return the string `"Hello, Bob, Charlie, and Dianne."`.

## Requirement 8

Allow the input to escape intentional commas introduced by Requirement 7. These can be escaped in the same manner that CSV is, with double quotes surrounding the entry. For example, when `name` is `["Bob", "\"Charlie, Dianne\""]`, then the method should return the string `"Hello, Bob and Charlie, Dianne."`.
